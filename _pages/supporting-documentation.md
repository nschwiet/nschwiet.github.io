This section contains other projects I worked on throughout my MLIS degree. A few of these are more experimental and others stem from work I did in the Digital Humanities program.

Proposal for the Establishment and Future Development of a Greater Los Angeles Veteranâ€™s Affairs Archive
------

This project was completed for IS 431: Archives, Records, and Memory where I had the opportunity to work with my classmates and the Los Angeles Veteran's Affairs to develop a proposal and outline for the development of an archive on site. For this project I contributed work primarily towards the archive mission statement and plan of action.

[Understanding Disinformation](/dh201.html)

This project was completed for DH 201: Introduction to Digital Humanities. For this project I used a Facebook advertising dataset related to misinformation ads leading up to and during the 2016 presidential election.
