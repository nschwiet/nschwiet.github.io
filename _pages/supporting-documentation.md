This section contains other projects I worked on throughout my MLIS degree. A few of these are more experimental and others stem from work I did in the Digital Humanities program.

Information Studies Projects
======

Proposal for the Establishment and Future Development of a Greater Los Angeles Veteranâ€™s Affairs Archive
------
This project was completed for IS 431: Archives, Records, and Memory where I had the opportunity to work with my classmates and the Los Angeles Veteran's Affairs to develop a proposal and outline for the development of an archive on site. For this project I contributed work primarily towards the archive mission statement and plan of action.

Preserving Video Games
------
For IS 480: Introduction to Media Archiving & Preservation I worked with a group to survey the current state of archiving complex multimedia objects with a focus on video games. For this project we interviewed a librarian from Standford who specializes in archiving video games and used the platform Twine to synthesize our interview and research. We chose Twine as it is a popular indie game platform, begging the question of preserving complex media that is platform dependent and intertwining game like mechanics.

Digital Humanities Projects

[Understanding Disinformation](/dh201.html)
------
This project was completed for DH 201: Introduction to Digital Humanities. For this project I used a Facebook advertising dataset related to misinformation ads leading up to and during the 2016 presidential election.
