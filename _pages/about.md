I am a MLIS student in the Department of Information Studies at UCLA. My interests include surveillance, aesthetics, and games. 

Portfolios
======
In order to showcase my graduate studies I created two portfolios. My [MLIS](/mlis-portfolio) portfolio documents a critical issue, papers representative of my coursework, a professional development statement, and a list of courses and advising history.

My [Digital Humanities](/dh-portfolio) portfolio highlights research interests and projects carried out in the Digital Humanities.
