I am an PhD student in the Department of Information Studies at UCLA. My interests include surveillance, aesthetics, and games. 

Portfolios
======
In order to showcase my graduate studies I created two portfolios. My [MLIS portfolio](/mlis-portfolio) documents a critical issue, papers representative of my coursework, a professional development statement, and a list of courses and advising history.

My [Digital Humanities portfolio](/dh-portfolio) highlights research interests and projects carried out in the Digital Humanities.

CV

Me
======
Outside of Information Studies I'm an aspiring amateur mycologist and budding bridge player. I also enjoy bouldering, board games, and making noise. Here's a picture of me and bolete in the Eastern Sierras.
