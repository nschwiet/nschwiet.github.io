I am a MLIS student in the Department of Information Studies at UCLA. My interests include surveillance, information literacy, and games. 

Portfolios
======
In order to showcase my studies, I created two portfolios, both of which are on this site. For my MLIS degree I created a [portfolio](/mlis-portfolio) that documents a critical issue that I am interested in, papers representative of my coursework, a professional development statement, and a list of courses and advising history.

For my Digital Humanities certificate, I created a [portfolio](/dh-portfolio) that highlights my research interests and projects in the Digital Humanities.

CV
