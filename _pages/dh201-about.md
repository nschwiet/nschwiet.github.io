# Data

The data used in this investigation is primarily from Facebook as presented to the Intelligence House Committee by Facebook during the [November 2017 open hearings on social media companies](https://intelligence.house.gov/social-media-content/).

The particular data used in this project has been [extracted and compiled by the Department of Communication at the University of Maryland](https://mith.umd.edu/irads/data.zip). The tag matrix developed in a University of Maryland course was used prominently for this project.

[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) was ued to perform a variety of analyses and visualization on the data. Embedded interactive graphics are hosted on Tableau Public.

[Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org). The static images of network graphs were created using Cytoscape.

[OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/), along with Excel, were used to clean data.

[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) was used to flip the matrix into an edgelist for graphing purposes. It was also used to test plotting of network graphs.
