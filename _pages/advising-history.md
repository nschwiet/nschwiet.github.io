Throughout my time as a student I was under the advisorship of Professors Shawn Vancour and Jonathan Furner. During my first year, Professor Shawn Vancour was instrumental in assisting with my new graduate student life, advising me on issues related to student employment and bureaucratic obstacles I came across. At the beginning of my second year I changed my advisor to Professor Jonthan Furner who has provided me with insight and direction towards my academic interests. Beyond my advisors I was supported by many faculty in the department while an MLIS student. In particular, I would like to thank Professors Jean-Fran√ßois Blanchette, Johanna Drucker, and Gregory Leazer for their support as I applied to PhD programs over the last year.

The following is a list of meeting dates and faculty I met with over the course of my MLIS degree. This list is in no way exhaustive as I had several informal meetings and encounters over the last two years.
