/about.html

I am a MLIS student in the Department of Information Studies at UCLA. My interests include surveillance, information literacy, and games.
Portfolios

In order to showcase my graduate studies, I created two portfolios. For my MLIS degree my portfolio documents a critical issue, papers representative of my coursework, a professional development statement, and a list of courses and advising history.

For my Digital Humanities certificate, my portfolio highlights research interests and projects carried out in the Digital Humanities.
