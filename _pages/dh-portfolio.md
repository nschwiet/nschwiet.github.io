This page is the culminating work of my Digital Humanities certificate as specified by the [Digital Humanities Program](https://dh.ucla.edu/graduate-certificate/). It contains samples of work I created while pursuing the certificate as part of my larger MLIS degree as well as some examples of work I created as a student employee for the Digital Humanities and related jobs. It also contains an intellectual statement which highlights my contributions to the field and demonstrates a critical understanding of the Digital Humanities.

[Coursework](/class-history)
======
My coursework contains a list of classes I took pursuing my MLIS degree and DH certificate. The following projects are examples of output from select courses that count toward my DH certificate.

[DH 201: Introduction to Digital Humanities](http://miriamposner.com/classes/dh201w19/)
------
[Understanding Disinformation](/dh201.html) was completed for DH 201: Introduction to Digital Humanities. For this project I used a Facebook advertising dataset related to misinformation ads leading up to and during the 2016 presidential election.

IS 289/DH 202: Digital Methods for Research & Scholarship
------
While I was enrolled in this class I was also working as a Graduate Student Researcher with the Digital Humanities. As a result, I completed a project where I used data from the Digital Humanities Program to develop a set of [DH minor core competencies](https://sites.google.com/g.ucla.edu/is289/home) using textual mining. For more on the methodology and workflow of this project, see the [project statement](/files/IS289.pdf).

IS 271: Introduction to Computer Systems and Programming
------
While there was no culmulative final project for this class, the skills gained have manifested in various other projects and jobs. In particular, I used programming occasionally during my internship with the Digital Library Program to automate and optimize some of the processes of daily tasks. I also used my knowledge of programming to perform various tasks as a Research and Technology Instructional Consultant.

[ENG 203: Computers and Literary Research](https://meta.humspace.ucla.edu/tmi/)
------
For this class I worked a classmate to create a final project on [Twine](https://twinery.org/), [Of Hassles and Lifehacks](https://dylandnick.itch.io/of-hassles-and-lifehacks). This was an exploratory project that touched on themes discussed throughtout the seminar.

After using Twine in this course, I also employed on a different project for a separate course, IS 480: Introduction to Media Archiving & Preservation, where I worked with a group to survey the current state of [archiving complex multimedia objects with a focus on video games](https://nschwiet.itch.io/media-archiving-and-preservation-final).

DH 299: Directed Research in Digital Humanities
------
Currently I am enrolled in the DH Capstone with Willeke Wendrich where I am working with archaeological data. For this course, I am working with a classmate to study the design and workflows of data gathering and analysis in preparation for upcoming data entry changes in the field.


[Professional Work](/cv)
======
As part of my student journey I worked several jobs, all of which contained a digital dimension. This section highlights a few of my professional experiences that resulted in Digital Humanities projects or similar.


Digital Humanities GSR
------
I worked as a Graduate Student Researcher for the Digital Humanities Program where I created an [interactive visualization](https://public.tableau.com/profile/nickschwieterman#!/vizhome/taxonomy_15718442080640/Dashboard2) for locating elective courses in the minor based on primary and secondary approaches to knowledge and practice.
