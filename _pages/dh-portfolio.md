This page is the culminating work of my Digital Humanities Certificate as specified by the [Digital Humanities Program](https://dh.ucla.edu/graduate-certificate/). It contains samples of work I created while pursuing the certificate as part of my larger MLIS degree as well as some expamles of work I created as a student employee for the Digital Humanities and related jobs. It also contains an intellectual statement which highlights my contributions to the field and demonstrates a critical understanding of the Digital Humanities.
