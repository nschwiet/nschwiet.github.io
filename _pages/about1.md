I am a MLIS student in the Department of Information Studies at UCLA. My interests include surveillance, information literacy, and games. 

Portfolios
======
In order to showcase my graduate studies, I created two portfolios. For my [MLIS degree](/mlis-portfolio) my portfolio documents a critical issue, papers representative of my coursework, a professional development statement, and a list of courses and advising history.

For my [Digital Humanities](/dh-portfolio) certificate, my portfolio highlights research interests and projects carried out in the Digital Humanities.
